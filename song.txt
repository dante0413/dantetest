I hate feelin' like this
I'm so tired of tryin' to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of is waking to you
Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missin'
And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losin' you
Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'less I feel you next to me
The way you make me feel
(Wakin' up to you never felt so real)
I hate livin' without you
Dead wrong to ever doubt you
But my demons lay in waitin'
Tempting me away
Oh how I adore you
Oh how I thirst for you
Oh how I need you
Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you
I don'tâ€¦
