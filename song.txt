I hate feelin' like this
I'm so tired of tryin' to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of is waking to you
Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missin'
And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losin' you
Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'less I feel you next to me
